The IPFS community is as decentralized and distributed as IPFS itself. Our community members are globally located, active both online and in person, and use IPFS in countless different ways. You can learn about meetings, events, apps people are building, and more with the resources listed here.

## Discussion/Support Forum

Join the conversation on the [IPFS Forums](https://discuss.ipfs.io/) for everything from technical questions, project brainstorming, talk on IPFS use cases and more.

## Research Discussion

The [IPFS Collaborative Notebook for Research](https://github.com/ipfs/notes) repo tracks discussions on topics related to IPFS research, ideas and proposals for new systems/features, and other items that haven't yet been tracked into a specific project.

## Events Calendar

Find all of the open community video calls for the IPFS project in the [IPFS Community events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com).

## Community Tools
